    ## Setup

    ### Basic setup

    1. Check out the `dev` branch:
        ```sh
        git checkout dev
        ```
    2. Create a new branch:
        ```sh
        git checkout -b feature/my-cool-thing
        ```
    3. Install dependencies:
        ```sh
        yarn
        ```

    ### Run the World of Jackson

    ```sh
    yarn dev-remote
    ```

    This will use the dev API hosted at [https://world-of-jackson-git-dev.blacksocialists.now.sh/api](https://world-of-jackson-git-dev.blacksocialists.now.sh/api)

    ### Develop components in isolation

    ```sh
    yarn storybook
    ```

    ### Develop API endpoints

    To make changes to the API, you'll first need to create your own [Vercel](https://vercel.com) project:

    #### Additional setup

    1. Configure your Vercel project
        1. Create an account
        2. Create a project
        3. In the general settings, add the following environment variables:
            - Production environment:
                - `CONTENTFUL_CONTENT_DELIVERY_API_TOKEN`: `u2t0rmxih-X9gkSpY_95PZJVa24-ufFSK4iVfPxPDho`
                - `CONTENTFUL_ENVIRONMENT`: `master`
                - `CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID`: `7zzvnrgo4q2e`
            - Preview & development environments
                - `CONTENTFUL_CONTENT_DELIVERY_API_TOKEN`: `YxKrxYCp3AdRcB4wRjFS_tIT49DyByCqyogZ-K-kJmE`
                - `CONTENTFUL_ENVIRONMENT`: `dev`
                - `CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID`: `7zzvnrgo4q2e`
    3. Configure your local environment
        1. Install `now` globally:
            ```sh
            yarn global add now
            ```
        2. Link your local repo to your Vercel project:
            ```sh
            now
            ```
        3. Pull your environment variables:
            ```sh
            now env pull
            ```

    #### Run the World of Jackson with your local API

    ```sh
