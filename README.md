# World of Jackson

World of Jackson will be an interactive feature accessed from the [Dual Power Map](https://blacksocialists.us/dual-power-map), which plots cooperatives and Dual Power Projects around the US. As the only project of its kind so far, [Cooperation Jackson](https://cooperationjackson.org/intro) is highlighted, and is the subject of what we're building in this repo.

**NOTE**: The code is currently not in the default branch. If you're looking to contribute, look at the [dev branch](https://github.com/BSA-US/world-of-jackson/tree/dev)

The following issues are necessary to move dev into the default branch:
